# @shopify/cli-hydrogen

## 7.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Support scaffolding projects from external repositories using the `--template` flag. ([#1867](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1867)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  The following examples are equivalent:

  ```sh
  npm create @shopify/hydrogen -- --template shopify/hydrogen-demo-store
  npm create @shopify/hydrogen -- --template github.com/shopify/hydrogen-demo-store
  npm create @shopify/hydrogen -- --template https://github.com/shopify/hydrogen-demo-store
  ```

- ✨ Added `npx shopify hydrogen customer-account push` command to CLI that takes the url in `--dev-origin` and push the config to Shopify Admin ([#1804](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1804)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

  ✨ Added `--customer-account-push` flag to the dev CLI command. This flag is meant be use for storefront that uses [Customer Account API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/customer). It create a tunnel, and push the tunnel url to Shopify Admin.
  ✨ skeleton template now use `dev --customer-account-push` to start dev server

### Patch Changes

- Bump internal workerd dependency to fix a bug when running on Node 21. ([#1866](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1866)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add `--quickstart` flag option to init/create command ([#1822](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1822)) by [@gfscott](https://github.com/gfscott)

- Handle duplicate storefront names when running `link` command ([#1860](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1860)) by [@gfscott](https://github.com/gfscott)

## 7.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Change the required Vite version to `~5.1.0` instead of `^5.1.0` to avoid breaking changes in experimental APIs that will be introduced in Vite 5.2.0. ([#1830](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1830)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

## 7.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Update `@shopify/cli-kit` dependency to `3.56.3` and improve some help messaging. ([#1786](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1786)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Hide a non-actionable warning about a deprecated Node.js module `punycode`. ([#1801](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1801)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add experimental support for Vite projects. ([#1728](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1728)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  To test this unstable feature, make sure you're running the latest version of the Hydrogen CLI, then run `npx shopify hydrogen setup vite` in your Hydrogen project. This command edits existing files and creates some new ones required to run Vite.

  Please report [any issues you run into](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%3Aunverified&projects=&template=bug_report.yml), and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

- Fix an issue that could cause the local worker runtime to freeze. ([#1819](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1819)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`4e3d5b00`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/4e3d5b005941db9a6d8eb2a5d7edf23148d60b07)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.2.2

## 7.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Adds new command line flag options for the `deploy` command: ([#1736](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1736)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

  - `build-command`: Allows users to specify which command is used to build the project (instead of the default build function). This provides more flexibility for projects that have custom build processes.
  - `no-lockfile-check`: Allows users to skip the lockfile check during the build process. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to bypass the lockfile check for certain reasons, such as in monorepos, where the lockfile resides in the root folder.

- Adding skip-verification flag to hydrogen deploy command ([#1770](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1770)) by [@lynchv](https://github.com/lynchv)

### Patch Changes

- Add `--env-file` flag to the `deploy` command ([#1743](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1743)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

  Optionally provide the path to a local .env file to override the environment variables set on Admin.

- This is an important fix to a bug with 404 routes and path-based i18n projects where some unknown routes would not properly render a 404. This fixes all new projects, but to fix existing projects, add a `($locale).tsx` route with the following contents: ([#1732](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1732)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

  ```ts
  import {type LoaderFunctionArgs} from '@remix-run/server-runtime';

  export async function loader({params, context}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
    const {language, country} = context.storefront.i18n;

    if (
      params.locale &&
      params.locale.toLowerCase() !== `${language}-${country}`.toLowerCase()
    ) {
      // If the locale URL param is defined, yet we still are still at the default locale
      // then the the locale param must be invalid, send to the 404 page
      throw new Response(null, {status: 404});
    }

    return null;
  }
  ```

- Non-zero exit codes are now honored ([#1766](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1766)) by [@graygilmore](https://github.com/graygilmore)

## 7.0.1

- Updated dependencies [[`c7b2017f`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/c7b2017f11a2cb4d280dfd8f170e65a908b9ea02)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.2.1

## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

- Make the worker runtime the default for the local development server when running `dev` and `preview`. To access the legacy Node.js runtime, pass the `--legacy-runtime` flag.

- Remove deprecated `build` command flags `--base`, `--entry`, `--target`. Additionally, `--codegen-unstable` is now `--codegen`. ([#1640](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1640)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

### Minor Changes

- Check for local project GraphQL config files (example: `.graphqlrc.yml`) when running in Codegen mode ([#1577](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1577)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add `deploy` command to Hydrogen CLI ([#1628](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1628)) by [@graygilmore](https://github.com/graygilmore)

  You can now deploy your Hydrogen app without connecting to GitHub. Run the `deploy` command from your local terminal or configure your own CI/CD workflows from any platform.

  Run `npx shopify hydrogen deploy --help` for more details.

- Add `--diff` flag to `dev` and `build` commands, used for building Hydrogen app examples. ([#1549](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1549)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add `--template` flag to enable scaffolding projects based on [examples](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/main/examples) from the Hydrogen repo. ([#1608](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1608)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Example: `npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest -- --template multipass`.

- Remove bundle-size check from the `build` command, in favor of checking server-side with `deploy` ([#1614](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1614)) by [@benwolfram](https://github.com/benwolfram)

- - Update example and template Remix versions to `^2.5.1` ([#1639](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1639)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

  - Enable Remix future flags:
    - [`v3_fetcherPersist`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-fetchers#additional-resources)
    - [`v3_relativeSplatpath`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-resolved-path#splat-paths)

- Add the option to create a new storefront when running the `init` command ([#1681](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1681)) by [@aswamy](https://github.com/aswamy)

- Updated dependencies [[`0241b7d2`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/0241b7d2dcb887d259ce9033aca356d391bc07df), [`9ad7c5ef`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/9ad7c5efee8bff63760b36a1a7c194f6bb8e07e5)]:
  - @shopify/mini-oxygen@2.2.5
  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.2.0

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the [`upgrade` command](https://h2o.fyi/cli#upgrade) to make it easier to upgrade from older versions of Hydrogen. Features: ([#1458](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1458)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

  - Automatically updates dependencies in your package.json file.
  - Generates a customized instruction file in the `/.shopify` directory, outlining any code changes required to complete the upgrade.
  - Adds a warning when running the `dev` command with an outdated version.
  - Defaults to the latest version. Pass a `--version` flag and a version number to select a specific one.

  To get started, run `npx shopify hydrogen upgrade` in your Hydrogen project.

- The worker runtime for development is now stable. This makes your development environment closer to parity with Oxygen’s production runtime. Pass the `--worker` flag with the `dev` or `preview` commands to enable it. This runtime will be enabled by default in the next major release. ([#1525](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1525)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add the `--debug` flag to the [`dev` command](https://h2o.fyi/cli#dev) to enable step debugging in browser dev tools. ([#1480](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1480)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  To enable debugger connections for the Hydrogen app worker file, run `npx shopify hydrogen dev --debug --worker`, then open [localhost:9229](http://localhost:9229) in your browser.

### Patch Changes

- Sync up environment variable names across all example & type files. ([#1542](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1542)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Serve assets from a separate domain when running the dev server, to better simulate cross-domain behaviors. This makes it more realistic to work with CORS requests, content security policies, and CDN paths in development. ([#1503](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1503)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Update all Node.js dependencies to version 18. (Not a breaking change, since Node.js 18 is already required by Remix v2.) ([#1543](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1543)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- 🐛 fix undefined menu error ([#1533](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1533)) by [@michenly](https://github.com/michenly)

- Fix how peer dependencies are resolved. ([#1489](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1489)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Update Shopify CLI versions. ([#1504](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1504)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

- Updated dependencies [[`69624b32`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/69624b3276fa18a654e222db226c7403ebdc8ead)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen@2023.10.2

## 6.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix Shopify login during the init flow where the process would just exit when awaiting for a keypress. ([#1481](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1481)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`074ef6e8`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/074ef6e88412dc4f731c253f1dcd27cb73afcc3c)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen@2023.10.1

## 6.0.0

### Minor Changes

- The Codegen feature is now considered stable and related dependencies have been updated. Use `--codegen` flag instead of `--codegen-unstable` to generate code from your GraphQL queries. ([#1108](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1108)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

### Patch Changes

- Updated internal dependencies to improve terminal output. ([#1456](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1456)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

  Please update the `@shopify/cli` dependency in your app to avoid duplicated subdependencies:

  ```diff
    "dependencies": {
  -   "@shopify/cli": "3.49.2",
  +   "@shopify/cli": "3.50.0",
    }
  ```

- Updated dependencies [[`a6f397b6`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/a6f397b64dc6a0d856cb7961731ee1f86bf80292), [`ad45656c`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/ad45656c5f663cc1a60eab5daab4da1dfd0e6cc3), [`ad45656c`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/ad45656c5f663cc1a60eab5daab4da1dfd0e6cc3), [`58dc68de`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/58dc68de2f71d12f1275961e160faa740387cdb5), [`0ae7cbe2`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/0ae7cbe280d8351126e11dc13f35d7277d9b2d86), [`ad45656c`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/ad45656c5f663cc1a60eab5daab4da1dfd0e6cc3)]:

  - @shopify/hydrogen-codegen@0.1.0
  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.10.0

## 5.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix template dist package due to CI error ([#1451](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1451)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

- Updated dependencies [[`3eb376fe`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/3eb376fe8796b50131dc43845772ae555e07a1a6)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.7.6

## 5.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Generated JavaScript projects now use Codegen and JSDoc to enhance editor autocompletion. ([#1334](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1334)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- We've added an experimental tool for profiling the CPU at startup. This is useful for debugging slow startup times when Oxygen deployments fail with related errors. ([#1352](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1352)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Run the new `h2 debug cpu` command to build + watch your app and generate a `startup.cpuprofile` file that you can open in DevTools or VSCode to see a flamegraph of CPU usage.

### Patch Changes

- Integrate the debug-network tooling with the new `--worker-unstable` runtime CLI flag. ([#1387](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1387)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`d30e2651`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/d30e265180e7856d2257d8cad0bd067c8a91e9cc), [`b81b452d`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/b81b452d010c650b1de1678f729945d1d4394820), [`1b45311d`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/1b45311d28b2ca941c479a1896efa89a9b71bec1), [`2627faa7`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/2627faa7f09ba306506bb206d4d6624de5691961)]:
  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.7.5
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.8

## 5.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix subrequest performance in development. ([#1411](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1411)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Increase the request body size limit to 100mb when running locally. ([#1421](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1421)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Updated dependencies [[`29414664`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/294146644df57592a775ae33cdf4359015155d72), [`832a0eaf`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/832a0eafad331f61b7cfdf90dec6427f1aaaef6b)]:
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.7
  - @shopify/mini-oxygen@2.2.3

## 5.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix product search results header style ([#1405](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1405)) by [@tatsuya](https://github.com/tatsuya)

- Updated dependencies [[`4f735fd7`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/4f735fd725aef26cd3bd5b50c87d2c028b93c598)]:
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.6

## 5.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Add token flag, environmentTag flag, environment selection screen, rename health check to deployment verification ([#1381](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1381)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

- Updated dependencies [[`eb9451ed`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/eb9451ed7883f610d1412bdab2553523859ac701)]:
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.5

## 5.4.0

### Minor Changes

- The build command now throws errors on CI when it can't find a valid lockfile. This should prevent unforseen issues related to dependency versioning in production. ([#1370](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1370)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  This behavior can be disabled with the flag `--no-lockfile-check`, which might be useful in monorepos or other setups where the lockfile is not available in the project directory.

### Patch Changes

- Add check to render collection images when available ([#1373](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1373)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

- Remove sourcemap annotations from client bundles. This prevents errors showing up in the devtools when the sourcemaps fail to load. ([#1364](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1364)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

## 5.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Make the CLI bundle analysis compatible with older Remix versions that don't output a metafile ([#1357](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1357)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

## 5.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `--worker-unstable` flag to `h2 dev` and `h2 preview` commands. This flag enables the use of the new experimental worker runtime for local development, which is closer to Oxygen production than the current Node.js sandbox. Please report any issues you encounter with this flag. ([#1184](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1184)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Add deploy command (disabled by default) ([#1019](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1019)) by [@vincentezw](https://github.com/vincentezw)

### Patch Changes

- Add magic cart and discount routes to skeleton template ([#1309](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1309)) by [@juanpprieto](https://github.com/juanpprieto)

- Updates placeholder page to suggest the `h2 setup` command, instead of `h2 generate route home` ([#1347](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1347)) by [@benjaminsehl](https://github.com/benjaminsehl)

- Adjust behavior of `h2 preview` command around environment variables to be more consistent with `h2 dev` command. ([#1184](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1184)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- We've added a tool for analyzing bundle sizes. You should try to keep your worker bundle small. The larger it gets effects the cold startup time of your app. We now include `client-bundle-analyzer.html` and `worker-bundle-analyzer.html` files in the build output. Open these in your browser to view an interactive analysis of your bundles. The CLI output also includes links to each file. Hydrogen also fails to build if your bundle size is over 10 MB. This is because Oxygen only supports worker bundles less than 10 MB. ([#1306](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1306)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

- Raise the subrequest limit to 100 for development. ([#1348](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1348)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Fix `--routes` and `--markets` flag when creating new projects. ([#1342](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1342)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Make sourcemaps to default be turned on. They were off to prevent sourcemaps leaking server code to the client. Oxygen now makes sure to not serve the sourcemaps, so it's okay to generate them. Also, when sourcemaps are present, we hope to enable sourcemapped stack traces in error logs on Oxygen. ([#1339](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1339)) by [@blittle](https://github.com/blittle)

## 5.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Delay installing certain dependencies to speed up project initialization time. ([#1272](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1272)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- (Unstable) server-side network request debug virtual route ([#1284](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1284)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

  1. Update your `server.ts` so that it also passes in the `waitUntil` and `env`.

     ```diff
       const handleRequest = createRequestHandler({
         build: remixBuild,
         mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
     +    getLoadContext: () => ({session, storefront, env, waitUntil}),
       });
     ```

     If you are using typescript, make sure to update `remix.env.d.ts`

     ```diff
       declare module '@shopify/remix-oxygen' {
         export interface AppLoadContext {
     +     env: Env;
           cart: HydrogenCart;
           storefront: Storefront;
           session: HydrogenSession;
     +      waitUntil: ExecutionContext['waitUntil'];
         }
       }
     ```

  2. Run `npm run dev` and you should see terminal log information about a new virtual route that you can view server-side network requests at http://localhost:3000/debug-network

  3. Open http://localhost:3000/debug-network in a tab and your app another tab. When you navigate around your app, you should see server network requests being logged in the debug-network tab

- Updated dependencies [[`71a07374`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/commit/71a0737438d51bae79330d3251f47355e814a453)]:
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.1.4

## 5.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix the default page shown when the project has no routes. ([#1266](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1266)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Hydrogen is now compatible with TypeScript v5. ([#1240](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1240)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  If you have `typescript` as a dev dependency in your app, it is recommended to change its version as follows:

  ```diff
    "devDependencies": {
      ...
  -   "typescript": "^4.9.5",
  +   "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    },
  ```

  After installing the new version of TypeScript, you may need to update the version used in your IDE. For example, in VSCode, you can do this by clicking on the `{ }` icon in the bottom-right toolbar next to the language mode (generally, `{ } TypeScript JSX` when editing a `.tsx` file).

- Fix development server port in some situations where it was set to a random number instead of the default 3000 or the `--port` flag value. ([#1267](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1267)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Fix transpiling TS to JS when scaffolding routes. ([#1273](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1273)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

- Support Remix Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and Hot Data Revalidation (HDR). ([#1187](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/1187)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  Start using it with the following changes to your project:

  1. Upgrade to the latest Hydrogen version and Remix 1.19.1.

  2. Enable the v2 dev server in `remix.config.js`:

    v2_meta: true,
    v2_headers: true,
    // ...
  }
  ```

  3. Add Remix' `<LiveReload />` component if you don't have it to your `root.jsx` or `root.tsx` file:

  ```diff
  import {
    Outlet,
    Scripts,
  + LiveReload,
    ScrollRestoration,
  } from '@remix-run/react';

  // ...

  export default function App() {
    // ...

    return (
      <html>
        <head>
         {/* ...  */}
        </head>
        <body>
          <Outlet />
          <ScrollRestoration />
          <Scripts />
  +       <LiveReload />
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }

  export function ErrorBoundary() {
    // ...

    return (
      <html>
        <head>
          {/* ... */}
        </head>
        <body>
          Error!
          <Scripts />

  - @shopify/hydrogen-react@2023.4.3
  - @shopify/remix-oxygen@1.0.7

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add **UNSTABLE** support for GraphQL Codegen to automatically generate types for every Storefront API query in the project via `@shopify/hydrogen-codegen`. ([#707](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/707)) by [@frandiox](https://github.com/frandiox)

  > Note: This feature is unstable and subject to change in patch releases.

  How to use it while unstable:

  1. Write your queries/mutations in `.ts` or `.tsx` files and use the `#graphql` comment inside the strings. It's important that every query/mutation/fragment in your project has a **unique name**:

     ```ts
     const UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY = `#graphql
       query unique_name_shop { shop { id } }
     `;
     ```

     If you use string interpolation in your query variables (e.g. for reusing fragments) you will need to specify `as const` after each interpolated template literal. This helps TypeScript infer the types properly instead of getting a generic `string` type:

     ```ts
     const UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_FRAGMENT = `#graphql
       fragment unique_name_shop_fields on Shop { id name }
     `;

     const UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY = `#graphql
       query unique_name_shop { shop { ...unique_name_shop_fields } }
       ${UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_FRAGMENT}
     ` as const;
     ```

  2. Pass the queries to the Storefront client and do not specify a generic type value:

     ```diff
     -import type {Shop} from '@shopify/hydrogen/storefront-api-types';
     // ...
     -const result = await storefront.query<{shop: Shop}>(UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY);
     +const result = await storefront.query(UNIQUE_NAME_SHOP_QUERY);
     ```

  3. Pass the flag `--codegen-unstable` when running the development server, or use the new `codegen-unstable` command to run it standalone without a dev-server:

     ```bash
     npx shopify hydrogen dev --codegen-unstable # Dev server + codegen watcher
     npx shopify hydrogen codegen-unstable # One-off codegen
     npx shopify hydrogen codegen-unstable --watch # Standalone codegen watcher
     ```

  As a result, a new `storefrontapi.generated.d.ts` file should be generated at your project root. You don't need to reference this file from anywhere for it to work, but you should commit it every time the types change.

  **Optional**: you can tune the codegen configuration by providing a `<root>/codegen.ts` file (or specify a different path with the `--codegen-config-path` flag) with the following content:

  ```ts
  import type {CodegenConfig} from '@graphql-codegen/cli';
  import {preset, pluckConfig, schema} from '@shopify/hydrogen-codegen';

  export default <CodegenConfig>{
    overwrite: true,
    pluckConfig,
    generates: {
      ['storefrontapi.generated.d.ts']: {
        preset,
        schema,
        documents: ['*.{ts,tsx}', 'app/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Feel free to add your custom schemas and generation config here or read from different document files. Please, report any issue you find in our repository.
